Purpose of the thorn:

This is a follow up code to Bowen York ID paper where after solving the constraints, we want to 
Construct the primitive variables from conformal ones. This is done by transforming pressure, density 
and lorentz factor along with gamma law to compute pressure, epsilon,  rho_0 and W. This is not an ideal 
solution and does have a problem. In constructing the primitives in this way, we ignore the polytropic equation 
of state which ends up being violated. While this is not ideal, there is no completely correct solution to this.
